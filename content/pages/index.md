          Matt was very easy to work with. His pricing was very fair and he
          worked hard to please us and give us exactly what we asked for. His
          crew was very friendly and hardworking. We definitely plan to use him
          for future projects. We would recommend Matt for any landscaping or
          hardscaping needs you have.

          Matt Swanson has a eye for what looks good. He understood my need for 

          balance in the design. He absolutely brought to life seemingly the
          red 

          maple I had planted in honor of my mom when she died. He pruned and 

          planted so her tree was highlighted and not obsured like it was. I am 

          grateful for this beautiful memorial. 


          His crew worked long and hard, doing a good job cleaning up. I was so 

          pleased with the final result that I hired him for two other projects.

          I could not be happier with Matt and his team.  They did a beautiful
          job
           with our landscaping!  Matt is so easy to work with and is 
          knowledgeable and creative.  He is always responsive and easy to 

          communicate with.  He had a vision for the work but was equally 

          interested in our ideas and did his best to bring them to fruition. 
          His
           rates are very reasonable, and he works quickly and efficiently. It is 
          such a pleasure to look out our windows or walk out the front door
          and 

          see our beautifully landscaped property.  Matt is a very talented 

          professional and I highly, highly recommend him.
